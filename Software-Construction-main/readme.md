# Software Construction: Process and Tools
Welcome to the course Software Construction: Process and Tools of the Computer Science program at Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences.

<br>

## General
You will work as a developer in a small team (max 4 students), where you will work together on existing (legacy) software in Python based on the available case. 
During this course, you will have to analyze, map, test and then refactor the software. At the same time, you will set up a CI/CD pipeline to continue testing, logging and monitoring during the development process. 
If everything goes well, you will expand the application with extra functionality.

## Workshops

### <a href="/Workshop - Requirements Specification/01_introduction.md">Workshop 1 - REST + Requirements Specifications</a>
In this workshop we will look at how to draw up requirements. 
What are good requirements and what should they meet, among other things. 
What is REST and how do APIs work, a short introduction and how to draw up requirements for it. 
Using examples, you will look at how you could analyze requirements from existing software, among other things.

### <a href="/Workshop - GIT/01_introduction.md">Workshop 2 – Git</a>
In this workshop we will look at the use of Git and GitHub. What terms are used and
what are they for, what is the normal way of working with Git and what is the difference with GitHub.
Throughout the course Git is the lifeblood of CI/CD and now we look at what, why and
how you use it.

### <a href="/Workshop - Software Testing/01_introduction.md">Workshop 3 - Software Testing</a>
In this workshop we will look at testing software. 
What do you test when, what methods are there to test and what do you need to take into account. 
What tools can you use and how will this help within our CI/CD pipeline.

### <a href="/Workshop - Refactoring/01_introduction.md">Workshop 4 – Refactoring</a>
In this workshop we will look at refactoring, what is it, what do you use it for and how do you apply it? 
How does refactoring contribute to making your software more maintainable and how can we apply this to an existing project?

### <a href="/Workshop - CI_CD/01_introduction.md">Workshop 5 - CI/CD</a>
In this workshop we will look at Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Development (CD), 
what is it, what do we use it for and what is the difference between Continuous Development and Continuous Delivery. 
We will look at tools, settings and start with the setup.

### <a href="/Workshop - Operating systems and Bash//01_introduction.md">Workshop 6 - Operating Systems + Bash</a>
In this workshop we will look at the use of Bash and its power within CI/CD. 
How different Operating Systems differ from each other. 
How to navigate between folders, how to create files, how to move and delete files and how to set permissions.

### <a href="/Workshop - UML/01_introduction.md">Workshop 7 – UML</a>
In this workshop we will delve deeper into the use and power of UML as a language for visually representing software or changes in software. 
We will look at the following components: Context diagram, ERD, Deployment diagram, Flowchart, State diagram, Swagger/OpenAPI
