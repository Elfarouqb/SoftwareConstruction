## Understanding the CI/CD Pipeline

Pipelines are fundamental to continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). Learn how CI/CD pipelines work and how they automate code tests and builds.

### Continuous Integration (CI): Frequent code integration, automated builds, and unit testing.
CI ensures that code changes are frequently integrated into a shared repository, allowing early detection of issues and promoting collaboration among developers.

#### Components:
1. Version Control System (VCS): Developers commit their code changes to a central repository (e.g., Git).
2. Automated Build System: When changes are pushed to the repository, an automated build process triggers. It compiles the code, runs tests, and generates artifacts (e.g., binaries, libraries).
3. Unit Testing: Automated tests validate the correctness of individual code units (functions, classes, etc.).
4. Code Linting and Formatting: Tools check code for adherence to coding standards.
5. Artifact Repository: The build artifacts are stored in a repository (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory).
6. Notification System: Developers receive notifications about build status and test results.

### Continuous Delivery (CD): Automated deployment to staging or production environments.
CD extends CI by automating the deployment process, ensuring that code changes are ready for production.

### Components:
1. Staging Environment: A replica of the production environment where code changes are tested.
2. Deployment Pipeline: A series of automated steps that take code from the repository to production.
3. Automated Testing (Beyond Unit Tests):
    -   Integration Tests: Validate interactions between different components.
    -   Functional Tests: Verify that the application behaves as expected.
    -   Performance Tests: Assess system performance under load.
4. Configuration Management: Tools (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef) manage server configurations.
5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Define infrastructure using code (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation).
6. Deployment Strategies:
   - Blue-Green Deployment: Spin up a new environment (green) alongside the existing one (blue) and switch traffic.
   - Canary Deployment: Gradually roll out changes to a subset of users.
   - Rolling Deployment: Incremental updates.
7. Feature Flags: Enable/disable specific features without deploying new code.
8. Monitoring and Logging: Monitor application health and log events.
9. Automated Deployment to Production:
If all tests pass, the code is automatically deployed to production.
Manual approval gates can be added for critical changes.

### Flow from Code Changes to Deployment:
Developers commit code changes to the VCS.
CI server detects the changes and triggers a build.
Automated tests (unit, integration, functional) run.
If tests pass, artifacts are stored in the repository.
CD pipeline picks up the artifacts.

In the staging environment:
- Infrastructure is provisioned (IaC).
- Application is deployed.
- Additional tests (performance, security) are conducted.

If staging tests pass, the CD pipeline deploys to production (based on the chosen deployment strategy).
Monitoring and logging track the applicationâ€™s behavior in production.
