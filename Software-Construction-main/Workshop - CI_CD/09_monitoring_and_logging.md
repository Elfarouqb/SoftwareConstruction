# Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring and logging are crucial aspects of any CI/CD pipeline. 


## Monitoring
Monitoring is crucial for understanding the health and performance of your software and CI/CD pipeline. Here are some key points to cover:

**System Reliability:**<br>
Monitoring ensures that your system remains reliable by tracking performance metrics, uptime, and response times. It helps prevent unexpected failures.

**Identifying Bottlenecks:**<br>
Monitoring reveals bottlenecks in your software or pipeline. By analyzing metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory, network), you can optimize resource allocation.

**Detecting Anomalies:**<br>
Monitoring alerts you to abnormal behavior. Whether it’s sudden traffic spikes or unusual error rates, early detection allows timely intervention.

### Monitoring Tools:
GitHub Actions Workflow runs generate real-time graphs that illustrate progress. Use these graphs to monitor and debug workflows.
View logs for each run, including status for jobs and steps in the workflow.
Enable additional debug logging if needed.

#### Datadog CI Visibility:
Integrating Datadog with GitHub Actions provides insights into your CI/CD pipeline, allowing you to optimize performance and detect bottlenecks2.

## Logging
Logging helps you capture relevant information about your software and pipeline execution. Here’s what to cover:

**Recording Events:**<br>
Logging captures events, such as user interactions, errors, and system activities. These records are essential for auditing and debugging.

**Error Tracking:**<br>
Logs help pinpoint errors, exceptions, and unexpected behavior. Developers can analyze logs to identify root causes and fix issues.

**Relevant Data:**<br>
Logging provides context. It records relevant data like timestamps, user IDs, and request details, aiding troubleshooting and forensic analysis.

### Logging Tools and Options:

### GitHub Actions Logs
View, search, and download logs for each job in a workflow run.

### Custom Logging Libraries: 
- Log4j;
- Winston;
- Serilog.

### Centralized Logging Solutions: 
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana);
- Splunk
