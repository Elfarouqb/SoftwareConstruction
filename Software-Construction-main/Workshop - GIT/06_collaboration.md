## Pull requests

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

More in depth information can be found on the [GitHub page about Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

### Creating pull requests.

GitHub has an excellent page on how to create a pull request.
You can find that page here [https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

### Reviewing and merging pull requests.

In a pull request, you can review and discuss commits, changed files, and the differences (or "diff") between the files in the base and compare branches.

Find more in depth info on the [GitHub page about Reviewing Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request)

:bulb: Sometimes you created a pull request and you want to request a review, [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review) gives you more in depth information on how to ask someone to review your pull request. 

## Issues

GitHub Issues are items you can create in a repository to plan, discuss and track work.

Issues are simple to create and flexible to suit a variety of scenarios. You can use issues to track work, give or receive feedback, collaborate on ideas or tasks, and efficiently communicate with others.

### Creating an issue

Issues let you track your work on GitHub. When you mention an issue in another issue or pull request, the issue's timeline reflects the cross-reference so that you can keep track of related work. To indicate that work is in progress, you can link an issue to a pull request. When the pull request merges, the linked issue automatically closes.

To create an issue, there are multiple options available in GitHub. Follow the detailed information on the [GitHub page about creating an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue)

### Linking a pull request to an issue

You can link a pull request or branch to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when the pull request or branch is merged.

You can link an issue to a pull request manually or using a supported keyword in the pull request description.

When you link a pull request to the issue the pull request addresses, collaborators can see that someone is working on the issue.

More information about this option can be found on the [GitHub page about linking an Issue to a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)


### Assigning issues and pull requests

Sometimes it's handy to know who is working on an issue, or better assign someone to an issue or pull requests because they have the required knowledge.

If that is the case, you can assign someone to an issue or pull requests, more information can be found on the [GitHub page about assigning Issues and Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users)
